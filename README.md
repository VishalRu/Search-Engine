Search-Engine
=============

In this Project, we have implemented text based search engine using methods as discussed below:

1.) Indexed more than 25,000 web pages using Apache lucene library.

2.) Term-Frequency and Inverse document frequency based text search.

3.) Implemented the Vector Space Model (using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency weights) to rank web pages.

4.) Coded Authority/hub computation mechanism using the adjacency matrix and returned the top N authorities and top N hubs.

5.)	Engineered PageRank algorithm in java to return top N web pages.

6.)	Programmed K-means clustering in java to generate cluster of relevant web pages.

7.)	Extracted the Snippet and Title from top ‘N’ web pages to display them to the user so user can choose webpage, which is more relevant to his query.

8.)	Coded and applied Scalar clustering so that user can get relevant suggestions while typing query word.

And, after implementing above discussed algorithms and we analyzed the results using different input data set on differnt algorthms.

Please refer to the "Analysis of Algorithms in Text based Search Engine" for the analysis of various algorithms.

PS: Source Code can be provided upon request.
